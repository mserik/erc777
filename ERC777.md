# Understanding ERC777 and ERC1363 Ethereum Standards

## Introduction
Ethereum tokens have evolved significantly since the introduction of ERC20, the standard interface for fungible tokens. However, as the ecosystem has grown, new functionalities and more flexible token standards have become necessary to accommodate advanced use cases.

## ERC777: Advancements and Challenges

### Purpose and Key Features
ERC777 is a token standard that introduces advanced features like operator permissions, send hooks, and receiving hooks, which allow tokens to notify contracts when they are moved. This allows for more complex interactions within smart contracts when tokens are transferred.

### Problems Solved by ERC777
ERC777 addresses several limitations of the ERC20 standard, including:
- **Transaction Handling:** ERC777 tokens can reject transactions at the token level, preventing accidental losses (e.g., tokens sent to contracts that cannot handle them).
- **Increased Flexibility:** It introduces hooks that allow users to implement more complex logic that can execute during token transfers.

### Issues with ERC777
Despite its advantages, ERC777 faces some issues:
- **Security Concerns:** The standard's reentrancy potential due to its hook system can lead to vulnerabilities similar to those seen in The DAO hack.
- **Adoption Challenges:** ERC777's complexity and the need for backward compatibility with ERC20 pose significant adoption hurdles for existing projects.

## ERC1363: Payable Token Standard

### Purpose and Key Features
ERC1363 is designed to enable tokens to be used for payments and donations directly, without needing to use a separate contract to handle logic after transfers. This is aimed at simplifying the integration of token payments into applications and contracts.

### Why ERC1363 was Introduced
The primary motivation behind ERC1363 was to solve the issue of actionless token transfers in ERC20 and ERC777. By enabling functions to execute after transfers, it allows for immediate actions like confirming a purchase or activating a subscription.

### Problems Solved by ERC1363
ERC1363 addresses specific challenges, including:
- **Immediate Transaction Effects:** It allows the execution of further actions directly after the token transfer, enhancing transaction efficiency and effectiveness.
- **Simplification of Token-based Transactions:** This standard simplifies the token transfer process by embedding transaction-related actions directly into the token contract.

## Conclusion
Both ERC777 and ERC1363 introduce significant improvements over the basic ERC20 standard, catering to more complex and interactive use cases in the Ethereum ecosystem. However, each comes with its own set of challenges that need consideration. As the blockchain landscape evolves, the development of more robust and secure token standards will be crucial for the widespread adoption of Ethereum-based applications.
